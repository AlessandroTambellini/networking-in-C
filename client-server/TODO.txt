- I get `Unable to bind: Address already in use` if I close the server before the client
- I brutaly handle trasmission and reception of msgs. I just exit the while or exit the program.
- read the comments
- power of 2 sizes are more handy for future dynamic allocations-- thing about it
- the req could be more than 256, I mean is just sent in chunks
- isReqSent and isResRecv should be size_t
- if I enter empty space after a command, the command results as not valid (REQ_INVALID)
- if I enter PRINT before having written any code, the terminal is stacked

TERMINAL
    - PRINT:
        - print the program in a nice format. So, on separate lines
        - send the program in chunks of 256 chars
    - enable basic keys:
        - if I enter up arrow, the previous command shows
        - if I enter down arrow, the successive command shows
        - if I enter left arrow, move cursor to the left
        - if I enter right arrow, move cursor to the right
