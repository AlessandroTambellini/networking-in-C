- I brutaly handle trasmission and reception of msgs. I just exit the while or exit the program.
- the req could be more than 256, I mean is just sent in chunks. Stop the user from writing more than 256 chars. Otherwise it would be a broken request not managable

UX
    - if I enter empty space after a command, the command results as not valid (REQ_INVALID) --> allow empty spaces

- when you close the coding session, the program is deleted

TERMINAL
    - PRINT:
        - print the program in a nice format. So, on separate lines (not yet)
    - enable basic keys:
        - if I enter up arrow, the previous command shows
        - if I enter down arrow, the successive command shows
        - if I enter left arrow, move cursor to the left
        - if I enter right arrow, move cursor to the right
